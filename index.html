            <h2>About PC</h2>
            <p>A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it
                feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a
                computer expert or technician.</p>
            <p>Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated much of the
                personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows. Alternatives to Microsoft's Windows
                operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry, these include free and open-source Unix-like
                operating systems such as Linux. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) provides the main
                alternative to Intel's processors.</p>

                built-in screen and mouse.</p>
